## Observations

Data is our window into reality. All data in Ask Network is modelled as _Messages_. Messages can occur in the virtual as network traffic between computers, and in the actual as causal effects between physical systems. As cultural capital, messages are captured and preserved by default.

Software can only capture virtual messages as digital data and does not have direct access to causal effects in reality. To capture real world data, hardware sensors must be utilized. We assume that all real world sensors are communicating their measurements as virtual messages via networking protocols. Thus, an Ask Network node records network protocol sessions only, with interpretations of reality being applied after consensus.

## Domains

That message history is used to derive reproducible representations of the actual and virtual external world. Such reproducible representations are specified as domains that take observations as input, and derive conclusions about the past, present, and future external world, subject to explicit assumptions about causal relationships.

At each domains core lies a causal graph. One can instantiate a causal graph by integrating observations into explicitly assumed causal relationships, producing a context. On that context, it can be reasoned backwards in time (I observed this, therefore that must have happened), and forwards in itme (if I do this, expectedly that will happen).

Once conclusions about hidden variables or counterfactuals where made, they can be queried through a semantic query interface. Nodes in the causal graphs carry semantically computable annotations in IEML. Queries are standard CQL expressions on the uniform data model of a semantic-causal context, combined with the domains semantic annotations in the formulation of the query.

Domain modellers combine observation procedures, interpretation, authentication, causal assumptions, and semantic annotations into interoperable domain modules, producing an ever growing library of domains that model reality increasingly accurate.

Specifying representations of reality in standardized and thus interoperable causal-semantic models enables transferrable reasoning about the behavior of virtual and actual external systems (hidden variables), and unobserved but possible observations or actions (counterfactuals).

Furthermore, the network provides a continuous integration pipeline for domain modellers by testing their causal theories against real world data.

Essentially it is an accounting system for everything measurable, with an attached unambiguous reasoning machine for everything unmeasurable.

## Network of Beings and Things

Expressing semantic annotations in IEML ensures that all conceptualization has exact positions in the semantic sphere, which allows for rich analysis across domains.

Most importantly for social coordination is the identification of beings and things, with all of them being embedded in the same physical reality, although at different positions in the geospatial process. What follows is a virtual representation of the actual economy that is acted out, through which past economic activity can be analyzed and future economic activity arranged.

Let us first differentiate economic participants from everything else. An economic participant is everything and everybody that influences voluntary participants to a degree that the influenced participant accounts for. Essentially it's the set of everything that is directly or indirectly important to at least one voluntary participant, with voluntary participant referring to a being that uses Ask Network to coordinate.

Let us further differentiate between passive and active  participants:

Passive participants are things with no behavior of their own other than the natural laws that govern their physical body. Desired things are economic goods (for example, a glass of wine) whereas undesired things are economic costs (like waste).

Active participants are those beings or things that operate a sensory-motor cycle and posess decision making abilities over their action space. Senses (like eyes and ears) or sensors (like cameras or microphones) on their body are employed to capture sensory information, which further is interpreted and reasoned about with their mental capacity, and finally acted out in their motor system (like legs or electric motors). Notably, such a situational awareness implies each active participant has certain desires and aversions, regardless of them being self-conscious or not. Picking one action over another always comes with a tradeoff about what has happened and what could have happened.

Now let's distinguish between communicating and silent participants. Communicating participants are those that have mastered languages to a degree that allows them to communicate with other speakers of the language in use, whereas silent participants can't. Communicating participants are first of all humans, and second of all smart things with embedded computers that communicate through networking protocols.

We identify a human as every communicating participant which is not labeled as a thing. Simply because we haven't yet observed any animal being able to make use of internet protocols.

Humans can authenticate themselves by claiming spots on the economic social graph. Smart things can authenticate themselves with an onboard private key.
