# Positioning Ask Network

The history of banking is as rich and varied as human civilization itself, characterized by a constant evolution of methods and mediums to fulfill one of humanity's most basic needs: the exchange of value.

First we will outline current systems used in modern day banking.

Next, we explicate what problem each system solves and show how Ask Network is a suitable replacement for all those systems.

Further, Ask Network establishes a new paradigm of coordination markets which allow to negotiate social coordination directly, enabling the realization of non-exchangeable desires.

## Brief History of Banking

The journey of banking from its inception to its current state is a series of problem-solving milestones that progressively revolutionized how humans exchange value. Let's take a walk down this intriguing historical path.

**Bartering** emerged as an early solution to facilitate the direct exchange of goods and services. The driver behind this was the simple fact that exchanging goods and services could create mutual benefits. By trading something you have in surplus for something you need, both parties could end up better off.

However, the problem of 'double coincidence of wants' made this system inefficien. The use of **debt** also has ancient roots. Farmers in Mesopotamia and elsewhere used to borrow seeds and repay after harvest. The problem of trust, ensuring that borrowers will repay, was a significant issue here, often addressed through social pressure and legal codes.

To solve this problem, early societies adopted **commodity money**, such as gold or silver coins. It was a significant improvement but had its own issues like divisibility, portability, and durability.

**Banknotes** were introduced as a convenient alternative to carrying large amounts of commodity money. They represented a promise to pay the bearer a certain amount of gold or silver. This system worked well as long as people had faith in the institution issuing the banknotes. If that faith was lost, as happened during many banking crises, the system could collapse.

**Central banks** were created to stabilize the banking system and serve as lenders of last resort. Their oversight and control of monetary policy aimed to prevent bank runs and maintain the value of the currency.

In the 20th century, technology began to reshape banking. The **ERMA computer**, introduced in the 1950s, automated the tedious task of sorting and recording checks, laying the groundwork for modern computerized banking.

Before ERMA, tellers at banks had to manually sort and record each check. This process was not only time-consuming but also susceptible to human error. With the rapid growth of the post-war economy, banks were dealing with an increasing number of checks, and the manual method was becoming unmanageable.

ERMA changed all that by using Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) to read the numbers at the bottom of checks automatically. ERMA could sort checks, record account data, and even detect fraudulent checks. It could process about 240 checks per minute, a rate far beyond what any human could achieve.

By the 1970s, with the advent of mainframe computers, such **clearinghouse systems** began to take on a form that we might recognize as a precursor to online banking. These systems supported automatic payments and ATM transactions, simplifying the process of transferring funds between accounts, making transactions faster and more efficient.

However, this system also had issues, especially regarding international transactions. The **SWIFT** system was established to allow secure and reliable international transactions, but it has been criticized for its centralized control, potential for surveillance, and vulnerability to sanctions and political pressures.

Despite these advances, the problem of economic inequality has persisted and, according to some analyses, worsened. Economist John Angle's work on the Inequality Process, or **Angle Process**, suggests that the increased volume of pairwise transactions may exacerbate wealth inequality over time, ultimately always resulting in an oligarchy.

## Solution

**Ask Network** aims to address many of the problems identified above. By using modern distributed ledger technology, it brings us back to the trust-based personal ledgers of old, with the trust ensured by cryptography, decentralization, and big data. It takes the concept of commodity money and updates it for the digital age.

It features a globally liquid basket of crypto assets, removing the need for a global banking standard that relies on national laws and voluntary participation.

Ask Network enables automatic multi-party transactions, removing the reliance on pairwise transactions and potentially leading to a more equitable distribution of wealth.

Ask Network is also fostering a new ecosystem of entrepreneurs who develop and operate coordination schemes, similar to how organizations have traditionally operated within the monetary for-profit framework, but with the use of coordination markets entrapreneurs now have access to scalable techniques for organization engineering and operation as never seen before. This can lead to a whole new range of innovative applications and services, potentially reshaping the financial and corporate landscape.

In conclusion, the Ask Network represents a fascinating evolution in the history of money, banking, finance, and commerce. As with all new technologies, its ultimate impact will depend on how it is adopted and used, but the potential is certainly there for significant innovation and transformation.
